## Background
SuperShop is an android application that is made to fulfill the final project of Mobile Computing course. SuperShop can be used to write down your shopping list to remind you of things to buy when going shopping. The inspiration of why I chose to make a shopping list applicationn comes from the fact when you write down a shopping list manually, it is hard to categorize the items. The SuperShop app supports categorization to help you with categorizing your shopping list.

## App Features

#### Home Page
First page that shows up when you open the app. With a notification containing my name as the maker of the app.

### Shopping List
After you've added items to the shopping list, you can view them by going back to the home page. Here you can filter the shopping list based on their categories and you can also delete them by swiping. To mark items as bought without deleting them, use the checkmark box.
